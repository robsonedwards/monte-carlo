# Diagram

## Setup

* Set up R project and git repo.

## Task 1

* Install `dslabs` and browse documentation. 

* Select a data set.

* Choose a research question. 

## Task 2

* Choose exactly two tests to implement, one parametric and one non-parametric, appropriate to research question. 

## Task 3 

* Develop methods for generating simulated data. (Under different "circumstances"... i.e. apply stuff from project 2?)

  * This is the actual diagram part

* Simulate data. 

* Develop tests (how hard?) and apply to simulated data

## Task 4

* Report the size and power of tests and comment on results of study.
